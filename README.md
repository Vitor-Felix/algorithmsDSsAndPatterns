# A review of Algorithms, Data Structures & Design Patterns

1. Try to implement these things, only by their general concepts. 
2. Search for better approaches.
3. Search for different solutions for the specific language.

### Elected languages

For fun I choose to implements with four languages that i liked to work with.

  * for having a language to work with more low-level concepts.

       <img alt="Java language logo" height=50px src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/java/java-original.svg" />

  * for having a strong OOP approach, mainly for the Design Patterns.

       <img alt="Kotlin language logo" height=50px src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/kotlin/kotlin-original.svg" />

  * because I started to work with it, and I'm loving it.

       <img alt="JavaScript language logo" height=50px src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" />

  * for being the more dynamic (and volatile) language that I know.

       <img alt="Python language logo" height=50px src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-original.svg" />

  * for the pseudocodish way of writing at its shallow level, but also having cool facilitators when you know more about the language.

Probably I'm gonna make some problem resolutions, but I'm already doing this in courses and problem banks, like FreeCodeCamp and Hackerhank. The objective is just to implement the basics at a relaxed pace, and slowly up the level. Just for fun and to keep things fresh in my mind.
